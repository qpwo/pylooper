# pylooper

I love to make looping audio recordings and I now I can do it on my computer live with no equipment or expensive software.

## First run

```
pip3 install pyaudio pygame
git clone https://github.com/qpwo/pylooper
cd pylooper
python3 pylooper.py
```

Everything is done with key presses. There are **mode** keys, **action** keys, and **registry** keys. Each sound is held in a registry, which can be any lowercase letter.
